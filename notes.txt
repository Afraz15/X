so that means that in the client, it will make or get a dummy_db ?


Yes, the client will make or get a dummy_db database. The use command in MongoDB creates a database if it does not exist, otherwise it switches to the existing database.
In the code snippet you provided, the dummy_client variable is a reference to a MongoDB client object. The dummy_client['dummy_db'] expression returns a reference to the dummy_db database
db.collection.insert_one({
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
})
